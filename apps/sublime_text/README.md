Sublime Text 3
==============

To setup sublime, open and go Preferences->Settings - User and copy the contents of `Preferences.sublime-settings`.

Then follow the directions [here](https://packagecontrol.io/installation) to install Package Control, restart, go to Preferences->Package Settings->Package Control->Settings - User and copy the contents of `Package Control.sublime-settings`. You will need to restart one more time, and then Package Control should start installing the packages.
