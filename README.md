dotfiles
========

Run `setup.sh`, which will copy dotfiles and install apps/tools/libraries. To see what will be installed, see the files in the `requirements` directory.

Some apps require licenses or login. Most of this information can be found in my 1Password vault. I foolishly bought 1Password from the app store, so will have to manually install from there again. Then, setup dropbox (using 1Password credentials from another device...) and set 1Password to sync from there.

There are also a few things that aren't scripted, such as importing the app settings in the `app` directory.
